## The Current State
Currently im mostly working on getting the mp3 player working properly with low cpu-usage, for that ill have to use a different library as libao is pretty outdated.
So This is not even close to finished.

## dependencies:
libfftw3,libao,libmpg123

```bash
sudo apt install libao-dev libfftw3-dev libmpg123-dev
```
